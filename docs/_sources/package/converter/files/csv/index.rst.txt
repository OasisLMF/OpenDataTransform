   converter.files.csv.BufferedCsvReader




.. class:: BufferedCsvReader(source)


   Bases: :py:obj:`io.TextIOBase`

   Provides the source as a csv file like object. This helps some data
   processors as they are happier reading files rather than working on
   iterables.

   :param source: The iterable to build the csv from
   :param buffer: The current stored data

   .. method:: read(self, size=None)

      Read at most n characters from stream.

      Read from underlying buffer until we have n characters or we hit EOF.
      If n is negative or omitted, read until EOF.

.. data:: NotFound
   

   

.. class:: Config(argv: Dict[str, Any] = None, config_path: str = None, overrides: Dict[str, Any] = None, env: Dict[str, str] = None)


   Configuration class that loads the config file, environment,
   command line and overrides and merges them into a single map.

   .. method:: __eq__(self, other)

      Return self==value.


   .. method:: get_config_sources(self, config_path: str = None, env: Dict[str, str] = None, argv: Dict[str, Any] = None, overrides: ConfigSource = None) -> Iterable[ConfigSource]

      Returns all the provided config sources in order of increasing
      precedence, the order is:

      1. Config file
      2. Environment
      3. Command line
      4. Hard coded overrides

      :param config_path: The path to the config file
      :param env: The systems environment dict
      :param argv: Dict of config paths to values
      :param overrides: hard coded override values for the config

      :return: An iterable of normalised configs from the various sources


   .. method:: process_cli_options(self, argv)


   .. method:: process_env_options(self, env)


   .. method:: merge_config_sources(self, first: ConfigSource = None, second: ConfigSource = None, *others: ConfigSource) -> ConfigSource

      Merges any number of config sources the later sources taking precedence
      over the former.

      :param first: The first source
      :param second: The second source
      :param others: The other sources

      :return: The merged config source


   .. method:: deep_merge_dictionary_items(self, first: Any, second: Any) -> ConfigSource

      Merges the 2 dictionary entries, the process is as follows:

      1. If the element from the first dictionary is not found use the
         element from the second independent from type
      2. If the element in the second dictionary is not a dictionary and has
         been found stop here and use it
      3. If the second element isn't found and the first has use the first
         value
      4. If both elements have been found then use the merge of the 2

      :param first: The first dict or the value from the first dict to try
          to merge
      :param second: The second dict or the value from the second dict to
          try to merge

      :return: The merged result


   .. method:: normalise_property_names(self, d: ConfigSource) -> ConfigSource

      Converts all names in all levels of the dictionary to lowercase

      :param d: The dictionary to normalise

      :return: The normalised dictionary


   .. method:: normalise_property(self, key: str, value: Any) -> Tuple[str, Any]

      Gets the normalised (lowercase) name with the normalised value.
      If the value is a dictionary it is normalised otherwise the value
      is returned unchanged.

      :param key: The key name for the entry
      :param value: The value for the entry

      :return: A 2-tuple of the normalised key and value of the entry


   .. method:: get(self, path: str, fallback: Any = NotFound) -> Any

      Gets a property from the configuration from it's path in the config.
      The path should be dotted path into the config. For example, with the
      config::

           {
              "foo": {
                  "bar": "baz"
              }
           }

      The path `"foo.bar"` would return `"baz"` and the path `"foo"` would
      return `{"bar": "baz"}`.

      If the path isn't found in the config the `fallback` value is used if
      one is provided, if no fallback is provided a `KeyError` is raised.

      :param path: The path of the requested value into the config.
      :param fallback: The value to use if the path isn't found.

      :return: The found path ot fallback if provided


   .. method:: to_yaml(self)

      Generates a yaml string  representation of the normalised config

      :return: The yaml representation


   .. method:: absolute_path(self, p)

      Gets the absolute path relative to the config files directory.

      :param p: The path relative to the config file

      :return: The absolute path if both the config path and `p` are set,
          if `p` is `None`, `None` is returned. If the config path is `None`,
          `p` is returned without modification
